# Regional-Sales-Gap-Analysis

 **About the Dataset**
This dataset is based on retail transactional data from a Superstore operating across the United States. It contains detailed information about customer orders, including:
- Order Date
- Product Category & Sub-Category
- Region
- Sales, Profit, Discount, and Quantity
- Customer Segment
- Shipping Mode

**Business Questions to Answer**
This project focuses on identifying gaps between sales performance and actual profitability across products and regions. Key questions include:
1. Which regions or categories underperform?
2. Where are we losing profits despite high sales?
3. Which products are high volume but low profit margins?

**What This Report Is About**
This report looks into how different regions and products are performing in terms of sales and profit. My main goal was to find out why some areas with good sales are still not making money, and what can be done about it.
